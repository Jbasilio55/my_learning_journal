How I stay committed to learning I like to think of myself as a lifelong
learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple
projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning
and most things about my journey with the world. How I got started I started
simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about
what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only
reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using
my own words. That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that
posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
